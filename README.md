# PrGeFNE

description:  
Identifying disease-related genes is of importance for understanding of molecule mechanisms of diseases, as well as diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Many computational methods for predicting disease-related genes have been proposed, while how to make full use of multi-source information (e.g., disease-phenotype associations and protein-protein interactions) to enhance the performance of disease-gene prediction is still an open issue. Here, we proposed a novel method for predicting disease-related genes by using fast network embedding (PrGeFNE). Specifically, a heterogeneous network is first constructed by using disease-gene, disease-phenotype, protein-protein and gene-GO associations; and the low-dimensional vector representation of nodes is extracted from the heterogeneous network by using a fast network embedding algorithm. Then, a dual-layer heterogeneous network is reconstructed by using the low-dimensional vector representation, and a network propagation is applied to the dual-layer heterogeneous network to predict disease-related genes. Through 5-fold cross-validation and newly added association validation, we displayed the important roles of different types of association data in enhancing the ability of disease-gene prediction, and confirmed the excellent performance of PrGeFNE by comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we developed a web tool to facilitate researchers to search for candidate genes predicted by PrGeFNE that are unknown to be related to diseases. This may be useful for investigation of diseasesâ€™ molecular mechanisms as well as their experimental validations.
